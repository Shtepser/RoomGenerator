# Dungeon Room Content Generator

That simple program is designed to help in dungeon mastering.

It uses the following rules for random content creation:

* There is two-in-six chance that there are monsters in the room and one-in-six chance for a trap in the room;
* There is one-in-six chance for an empty room and three-in-six chance for a room with monsters that there are treasure in the room.
